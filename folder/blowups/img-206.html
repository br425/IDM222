<h1>Pastel Mosaic Turtles</h1>	
<p>An old foray into color mixing and contrast. I picked a simple, abstract design, and put it on a grid. The idea was to keep to basic color schemes for each, and explore as many tones and saturations of that color as I could, while changing as I hit every line. Altogether this forms a kind of mosaic. It was one of my more inpressional pieces from art school, and I never really appriciated it as much for its lack of technical detail, but now I find that it's pretty neat. It's fine. It's great. One of a kind. BUY NOW! Syke, it's priceless.</p>
