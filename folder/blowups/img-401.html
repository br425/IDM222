<h1>Metroid Gradation Collage</h1>	
<p>This is a pastel still life of a white lotus I did back in 9th grade. At the time, that project was my opus achievement, but at the same time it was never really called 'done'. I ended up spending weeks (probably about 15-25 hours in all) toiling over the fine subtlety of the colors. My teacher Mrs. Seufert was the biggest stickler for correct blending and pinpoint tone, and wanted me to push it all the way. I did my best, but just like all art, it's never truly finished, but abandoned at the last deadline.</p>
