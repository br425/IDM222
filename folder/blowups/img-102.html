<h1>Color Scheme Character Designs</h1>	
<p>My midterm project for perspective drawing in freshman year. I drew the stairwell of the Drexel Main Building, which ended up not being as challenging as I thought it would be. I'm generally an ambitious artist (too much so, as some teachers have warned) so I wanted to pick a challenging -or at least large- angle to draw this space from. Overall, the arches were the most difficult aspect to draw, and their shifting angles is why the line weight is so much heavier in that area. I intentionally left the far end of the stairwell unfinished, first because it was grueling and tedious to make the stairs, and second because it let me show the dimensionality of the space under it, which my teacher found interesting.</p>
