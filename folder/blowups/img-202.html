<h1>Charcoal Self Portrait</h1>	
<p>A Christmas present to my mom in 2015. Throughout my artistic progress, I would be lovingly pushed to create self-portraits, for posterity. I've never felt that comfortable drawing own face with such external attention, but it's more natural than making someone else's face, and I guess I've gotten used to it over the years. I'm highlighting this portrait because it's the most recent; however, in the months I've dawdled before digitizing the piece it's gotten pretty fuzzy and granular... so, it looked better. I may do another one this year that will be much cleaner, but at this point it's not as interesting because my look and features haven't changed much, and won't drastically change during my foreseeable adulthood. So with that in mind, this is pretty much what I look like.</p>
