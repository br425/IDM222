<h1>White Charcoal Statue Faces</h1>	
<p>An exercise in figure drawing from back at Seufert Art in high school. This wasn't a live model, clearly, but a statue the Seuferts found in Italy. Taking on a stilllife realizing the tone and musculature of that figure served as a landmark of your prowess back at that school. I had a knack for it at the time, and got interested in figure drawing, as it seemed natural to me. Sadly, even in college I haven't taken a figure drawing class yet, and haven't gotten to do other life-like models like this. </p>
